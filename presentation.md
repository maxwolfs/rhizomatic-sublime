## presentation 1: the cheesy startup

Here at Rhizomatic Machines we think of Design & Technology not being tools that make the world a better place but make the world a more joyful place via meaningful interactions.

From the beginning we thought:
What if blockchain could do something useful? Not only being another futuristic specualtive asset or a senseless yet playful meaningful game like cryptokitties. What if we could contribute to the dilemma of social networks being actually antisocial bubble builders.

## presentation 2: cheesy fog

Imagine a world where you can be absolutely sure about your intercourse.
Rhizm is a new way to conduct intercourse with others. A seductive yet socially awkward moment to connect.

Wanna buy it?

## presentation 3: more truthful about what we want

Hello, We are Max and Alex from Rhizomatic Machines.
We have developed a new seductive collectible that enables you to conduct intercourse with others you have never met before.

The device itself is a custom designed PCB with the latest technology available on the market.

* Secure & encrypted
* WiFi
* Supercapacitor Power Supply
* USB-C
* IoT
* Blockchain

The device is focused on the Intercourse as the main interaction. How does it work?

Get a Rhizm card with an unique ID at one of our disposal machines or online at www.rhizomaticmachines.com. Find others and intercourse with them. If you found out that another person also has a Rhizm, you can perform the intercourse while holding both cards to each other. The magnetic contacts will let them snap together automatically.

This triggers each card to wake up from sleep mode and interchange their unique IDs which are saved to the card's storages. The successful intercourse triggers the lights that will create a satisfactory firework which draws all the available current from the supercapacitor.

Once the card is loaded again through its USB-C connector via your smartphone, computer or power adapter, it will automatically commit the intercourse to our API that stores a request in the database. If both cards have done that successfully the Intercourse is verfied and will be displayed in a visualization of every verfied intercourse at www.rhizomaticmachines.com.

This testifies a physical connection between two Rhizm cards which is secure and unique.

There is also a cooldown time with cards that had intercourse before in order to prevent Grinding and propagate social interactions with people you have never met before.

Each Card comes with a handcrafted velvet pouch.

Experience our prototpye at our Stand in the exhition space in Segment 7.
