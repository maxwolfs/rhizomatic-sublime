With Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerbergs current discussion about up- and downsides of AI developement,
question arise where everyday life leads in the next decades. In 1987 there weren't mobile phones,
the GSM has just been formalized by the European Comunity. 30 years later nearly everyone in the 
world has a smartphone, being connected to the world wide web. The calculation power has exploded
as the storage and memory space. The data being created has reached levels no one can even handle.

In the Industrial Revolution, better results were achieved by applying knowledge to
machines. In the productivity revolution, it was the application of knowledge to work. 
In the management revolution, the application of knowledge to the knowledge is based on systematic innovation, 
which can still increase productivity. 

Imagine a future where almost every aspect of our life is transferred to digitality by parameterizing everything.
Everyday life will then be calculated. Analog life will vanish. No nature, only culture. Here the most advanced
software-hardware combination will perform best in the internet of everything. Every human will have its own AI 
automatizing task from finances, decision what to read, like, consume, etc. This also means a gigantic increase of traffic
which will lead most probably into the loss of net neutrality. 

With every platform and service, private and public, parameterizing their little bubbles and creating APIs for their data 
exchanging working as Hubs; basically we are building a world/database not for us humas but for algorithms.
In 10years every single area in our life is digitalized, it might not be possible anymore to do public/legal actions 
the 'analog' way in a human interactable way.
