# Rhizomatic Sublime

Von Maschinen die Natur sein wollten
Maximilian Wolfs / Alexander Lehmann

## Concept

A meadow of elephant grass (miscanthus rhizomen) sways in airy currents.
Embedded in the green thicket machinic imitations of grass try to hide their
mechanical otherness. They are tricky, mimicking their natural environment.
Lurking for their conspecifics, the agents are searching for patterns, for
information that reveals exceptional artificiality in their surrounding.

Agents punish their rhizomaticly connected cohabitants for misbehavior, the
ones diverging from the natural normal. An artificial species tries to vanish
in sensorial noise, leaving behind their machine-like corporeality, becoming
sublime.

The noise of whispering leaves sets emerges from the moving meadow.
Agents try to mimic natural movement of grass.
Their aim:

I.	 Mimicry. Dissappear in Nature.
II.	 Identification. Eliminate Otherness.
III.	 Evolution. Spread knowledge to the rhizome.

Noise as non-signal and noise as sound: synaesthesia.

## Background

With Machine Learning evolving uncanny, hard to grasp technology that is also beginning 
to change the boundaries of what we can achieve intellectually
and nature being pushed back more and more our cultural environment, the diversity of lifeforms 
is reduced dramatically. In this setting we implement our poetic fiction of machines desiring to
act as nature, a plant and not as robotic worker in the duty of mankind.

## Installation

The final result will be an installation, 
a hybrid landscape constituted by machinic agents and plants.

## Why do we need Funding

The project is divided into to pars concerning the involved technologies: 
Machine Learning and Electro-mechanical Agents, software and hardware.
With the software being open source, the hardware for multiple agents produces
a high demand for parts that will be the subject of funding.
