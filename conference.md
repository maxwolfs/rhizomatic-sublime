Rhizomatic Machines

## Abstract

With Touch Screens being manifested as the current paradigm of interfacing the Internet, the world has made a decision. We invented an interaction. Rhizm is a smart card that creates decentralized social mesh networks via physical pairing. Combined with a Web Interface that shows the verified encrypted interactions (call it blockchain), Rhizm can be used for many different scenarios in which a physicial interaction between nodes must be safe. We understand our project as fundamental research in times of disbelief and scepsis within the realms of new technologies. Therefore we see it as a open source platform, a social sandbox for many diverse use cases such as self deployable social networks that are founded on real human interactions.
